# Location Tracker App

This Android Kotlin Application is part of the bachelor project - Decentralised Data Storage.

The app is able to do the following:
- **request appropriate permissions from the system**
- **let the user to set active hours**: Users can specify the times during which they wish to collect location data.
- **set automatic synchronisation of data**: The application automatically detects a home network and initiates data upload, even when the application is closed, using a continuously running foreground service.
- **set foreground service for location gathering**: The Application launches custom foreground service that remains active even when the user or the Android operating system decides to kill the main UI application.
- **export data to `csv`**

## Flow of the whole app from the very first opening 

### Association 
In the main storage system, the admin user creates a new app holder for this new application. They assign a name to it and obtain an association token, which is then used to associate this location tracking application with the holder in the system.

The user then enters the IP address of the system along with the port in the android app. The application is implemented so that the user must first check if the system is accessible before actually entering the association token.
    
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/3.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/4.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/5.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 3" />
</div>

After successful association with the system, the application receives a token (to be precise `jwtTokenForPermissionRequestsAndProfiles`), which it then uses to create profiles and request permissions to data and a button for continuing with registration is displayed to the user.

### Permissions requests

The application also requests permission to smartphone notifications, to location, and to background location, and finally asks to be excluded from the list of apps that the operating system restricts to save battery.

When requesting access to the user's location, the standard location permission (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`) itself is first requested and then the background location (`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`) as well.
Due to the more invasive nature of background location tracking, which continues even when the application is not actively used, the user is automatically redirected to the smartphone's settings. This redirection is necessary for the user to manually adjust settings and allow the background location.

If the application did not request an exception for battery saving, background location tracking would occur infrequently. Based on our extensive testing, it would not occur at all for pronlonged periods of time. This request, however, goes directly against the principles of the Android Play Store, and therefore such an app has trouble being published.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/6.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
</div>

### Registering Profile and Requesting Permissions For This Profile in Data Storage

The application then must register a profile in the system using the given token obtained after association. The profile contains a json schema showing what the generated data will look like.

#### Profile

```json title="locationTracker.com/profiles/location_profile"
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "latitude": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": -90,
      "maximum": 90
    },
    "longitude": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": -180,
      "maximum": 180
    },
    "accuracy": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "altitude": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "speed": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "speedAccuracyMetersPerSecond": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "time": {
      "type": "number"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "latitude",
    "longitude",
    "accuracy",
    "altitude",
    "speed",
    "speedAccuracyMetersPerSecond",
    "time",
  ],
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/7.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/8.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
</div>

After the profile is successfully created, the app needs to send permission request for being able to produce events of this type (i.e. of this profile).

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/9.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
</div>

When the request permission is registered in the system, the application notifies the user about the need to approve the permission. Otherwise the application won't be able to start synchronising the gathered data with the system.

## Application After Successful Setup

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/10.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/11.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
</div>


### Main features

The application displays the following information:
- When the last synchronization occurred
- Information about the last synchronization
- Number of locations that have not yet been synchronized
- Oldest unsynchronized location
- Total number of locations already synchronized


<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/12.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/13.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
</div>


In the application, it is possible to set the period during which the user wants the application to collect data. Outside this period, the app does not collect location, but it monitors whether the user is connected to the correct network for data synchronization possibilities.

As for automatic data synchronization, there is a UI switch that allows the user to choose whether they want such automatic synchronization.

Next, there is information about the network name, address, and port of the system.

If the user does not want data to be synchronized automatically, they have two options:
- Synchronize data with the server manually by pressing the `Sync Now` button
- or by exporting data to a `csv` file.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/17.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/18.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
</div>

During synchronization, the user is shown a progress bar along with the percentage of the synchronization process itself.

At the bottom of the main application screen, we see three horizontal buttons:
- A button to display a list of collected data
- A button for exporting to CSV (the user is shown a screen where they can choose the location and name of the file)
- Turning on the data collection service itself. This service must be activated for data collection. Once the service (`foreground service`) is activated, it is still possible to change settings such as automatic synchronization or network name without needing to restart the service. Thus, the application can communicate with it and send data not only at its launch.

Additionally, next to `Network for synchronization`, there is a gray button that redirects the user to a separate settings screen where they can change the network name and the system's address/port.

From this place, it is also possible to reset the entire application to its original state.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/14.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/15.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/16.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 2" />
</div>

`Foreground service` must have a persistent notification for proper functioning, which constantly informs the user whether it is successfully active, or during inactive periods (outside the data collection time interval chosen by the user) informs when the active hours are.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/19.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/20.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
</div>

As we are coming to the end of this app tour, there is the last screen that provides a list of gathered location data. This screen can be accessed by tapping `Show Data` button on the main screen.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require("/img/example-apps/location-tracker/17.jpg").default} style={{height: '60vh', marginRight: '1rem'}} alt="Location Tracker App Image 1"/>
</div>
